To run, download and open in your preferred Java IDE.

Enter in a list of numbers to the arraylist on line 93 in main.
After the array you wish to find the second largest value of has been entered, run the program to get the result.

*Note* Entered array MUST be a positive integer. There must also not be any duplicate values.

Program will return -1 if an empty arraylist is entered.
If a single value is in the arraylist, program will notify you that the list had only 1 value and return that value.
